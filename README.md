## Project Title
Hero Battle


## Team Members
Phillip Booker (game logic), Lucious Jackson (front-end), Michael Ramirez (API/heroes)

## Project Description
We created a multiplayer game featuring Hero objects built using information from the Marvel and GIPHY APIs using Firebase to store relevant game data. The layout was built using the Bootstrap grid layout.

In order to fit the superhero theme, we implemented the Cleave.js library to prepend everyone's username with "The Amazing" because this is a battle of heroes!

The game is controlled by a host who can start the game when they are ready. (Only the host can start the game.) The number of players is displayed on the screen so that the host can start when everyone is ready. There is also a chat players can use to communicate.

Once the host starts the game, the players will receive a message telling them to prepare for battle. Two random heroes will be chosen for Team 1 and Team 2. (All players will see the same hero.) Once the heroes have been set, it's time to fight!

Each team will click the attack button under the opposing team's hero to deal damage. Whoever can deplete the enemy team's health first wins!

Once the game is over, the player with the highest amount of clicks will be displayed in the chat for everyone to see!

The host will then have the opportunity to start the game again.

## Instructions
Enter your name.

Check your team (Team 1 or Team 2).

Prepare to fight!

#### Fighting
Click the "ATTACK" button on the opposing team to strike your opponent.
Weaken the strength of the opponent before your own expires.
The first to eradicate all of the opponent's strength wins the round!
