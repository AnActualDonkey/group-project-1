##Project Descriptions
We will be using the SuperHero API to get the stats of a super hero and use a gif to show its status. The objective to have users join the game and click buttons to inflict damage upon a common enemy. Funcitonality will be similar to the class "click down" activity, but with a common objective and increasing/varying difficulty. Each super hero/villain will have different stats to work with as retrieved from the API.
